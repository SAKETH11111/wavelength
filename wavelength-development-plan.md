# Wavelength Development Plan

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: Wavelength has successfully completed Phase 1 (Foundation & Modularity) with a functional MVP deployed to Vercel. The application features a modern Next.js 15.4.5 frontend with shadcn/ui components, comprehensive provider abstraction layer supporting multiple AI providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, XAI), real-time cost tracking, and an optional Python FastAPI backend for advanced features.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Pluggable provider system with unified API gateway
- ✅ Dynamic configuration management with UI settings panel
- ✅ Real-time token counting and cost tracking
- ✅ Dark/light mode theming
- ✅ Model selection with reasoning capability detection
- ✅ Background task processing with streaming support
- ✅ Deployed to production on Vercel

**Critical Gaps Identified**:
- No authentication or user management system
- Missing collaborative features (shared sessions, team workspaces)
- No RAG/knowledge management capabilities
- Absence of testing infrastructure
- Limited reasoning visualization (text-only, no graphical representation)
- No data persistence beyond local storage
- Missing enterprise features (audit logs, compliance, SSO)
